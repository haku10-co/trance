1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:05,630
Let's start the second game I'm losing 0

2
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:07,630
-1 I need to

3
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:13,810
pop off Okay,

4
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:15,460
so this is just South Africa, right?

5
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:15,650
But

6
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:26,110
where? Might be something like.. Closer to

7
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:26,620
Eswatini

8
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:32,570
Lesotho We have some mountains over there

9
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:35,470
Yeah, I'm gonna send something like here

10
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:37,630
Oh no,

11
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:40,750
definitely not East London Next round

12
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:44,180
we have tracker

13
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:48,670
No, this

14
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:53,540
is just a car

15
00:00:53,540 --> 00:01:00,410
And in water

16
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:03,120
okay so the hills look Colombian

17
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:03,600
I think

18
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,010
but it also might be Mexico

19
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:10,070
where is the Sun Sun is to the Sun

20
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,310
is saying nothing

21
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:15,080
it's not good

22
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,420
okay so it's gonna be a 50

23
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:21,400
-50 I guess between Colombia and Mexico

24
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,120
but my first thought was Colombia

25
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,300
so I'm gonna go here I thin

26
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:28,520
k It can be Yucatan,

27
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,840
it can be Campeje in Mexico,

28
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,040
but I'm going Colombia Let's see

29
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:44,060
Yeah, it was Nordele Colo

30
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:46,770
Not good

31
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:55,920
I should have committed more towards

32
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,260
north

33
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:59,930
I think it was a

34
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:01,330
mistake

35
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:10,240
but it's fine now

36
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,130
we have Ghana

37
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:16,190
probably nothing

38
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:20,120
some red dirt and we have some hills

39
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,060
I think Kumasi should be a good Good

40
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,700
guess over here

41
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,040
I think Okay,

42
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:30,360
we are fine

43
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:50,390
Next round

44
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:52,430
We

45
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:54,230
have English language

46
00:02:54,230 --> 00:03:00,380
We have some weird.. weird architecture

47
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,980
What is this car?

48
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,650
Is this a tracker?

49
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:08,780
This is no way

50
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,880
This is some kind of island

51
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,900
But I have no idea.. Okay,

52
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:19,950
with this sign.. Like

53
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:20,830
can it be like

54
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:24,670
one of islands close to Australia

55
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:26,110
I think

56
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:28,090
But which ones? Wait

57
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:32,240
No for sure

58
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,760
not this one

59
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,110
Like what else? Like we have

60
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:40,230
some kind of mixed American plus

61
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:44,830
Australian style here

62
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:48,670
What can it be?

63
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:49,720
Oh, wait,

64
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,660
maybe it's might be

65
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,570
the Christmas Island,

66
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:54,210
I think, or Cocos,

67
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:57,170
one of those two Oh, y

68
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,960
eah, that makes sense

69
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:02,140
But which one? Wait

70
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:04,670
So Christmas Island have this car

71
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:12,830
with like a black ending

72
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:16,260
But Cocos also have a specific car

73
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:19,900
And we have nothing over here

74
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,170
This is super weird

75
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:23,400
I've never seen anything like this

76
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,210
Okay, I'm gonna go between, I think

77
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:29,600
Like between those two

78
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,980
Because picking

79
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,830
one is actually maybe not a good idea

80
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,750
I'm gonna play defensive here Yes,

81
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:35,330
I'm gonna go betw

82
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:37,140
een those two Yeah, okay,

83
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:39,840
it was Christmas Island Sheesh

84
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,550
He knew it

85
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:46,340
That's unlucky

86
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:48,530
Next we

87
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:53,540
have India

88
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:58,690
Okay with these polls

89
00:04:58,690 --> 00:04:59,220
Okay

90
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,600
so I think this should be Southern I

91
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:08,190
ndia I unfortunately do not know the poll here

92
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:08,570
But yeah,

93
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:09,740
it's definitely southern

94
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:10,500
part of the India,

95
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:16,320
like maybe Karnataka, closer to Bengaluru

96
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,930
Can I see a bridge here?

97
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:19,120
We have mountains over there,

98
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:25,020
so maybe it makes sense

99
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,180
So I'm going to send something like this

100
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:33,500
maybe Like here

101
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:37,700
Yeah, let's just send

102
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:47,530
Oh, really nice

103
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:53,600
That's a huge damage And I won Nah, 1k

104
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,360
more 1k more, okay

105
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:00,670
So I can win I think I can win thi

106
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:03,450
s I just need a good rounds like this one

107
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:07,780
We have Greece, Greek language

108
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:12,990
We have a bay to the west

109
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:14,970
It should be just mainland

110
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:15,090
I

111
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:19,910
think I'm gonna send something like here

112
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:38,910
Okay, it was just a creepy island

113
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:40,230
It's still okay

114
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:44,080
though I just need small countries

115
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,400
and I can win

116
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:54,080
Okay, we have Poland

117
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,290
Probably just central Poland,

118
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:58,100
I think M

119
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,040
aybe more closer to the north,

120
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,240
I'm gonna come here

121
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:02,870
I think

122
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:04,340
Oh

123
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,010
no,

124
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:07,720
there's no way It was just southern

125
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:12,930
Poland Next round,

126
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:16,000
we

127
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:24,250
have Baltics, like Estonia or Latvia

128
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:27,400
I think Maybe Lithuania

129
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,460
also, we don't have Poles

130
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:34,170
That's not good

131
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:34,510
Okay,

132
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:36,990
so I'm not sure about the country here

133
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:37,450
So

134
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:40,870
I'm just gonna go in middle to the Latvia

135
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:43,210
and hope it's like close

136
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:46,840
Because we don't have any.. Okay,

137
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,170
maybe we have.. No, it's just trees

138
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:50,700
Yeah, so I think it should be fi

139
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,810
ne

140
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:54,670
It was just Estonia

141
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:56,770
Not good Next round

142
00:07:56,770 --> 00:08:03,800
Okay so this should be

143
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,990
with this car

144
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:10,590
New Zealand Should be Northern Ireland

145
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:14,130
I think Yes

146
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:23,560
let me just send like something like this

147
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:23,850
hope

148
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:27,140
it's not gonna be the southern island

149
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:32,330
because i am dead if it is so y

150
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:33,690
eah okay

151
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:37,340
it's fine you can get some damage here

152
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,970
next round

153
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:45,700
we have a

154
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:50,230
mexican Wait,

155
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,300
it's not Mexico

156
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,040
It's Romanian,

157
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:57,820
I think Taxi Maybe it's not a taxi

158
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,270
I thought

159
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:00,940
in the first instance it's Mexico,

160
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,840
but we definitely are not in Mexico

161
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,550
We have European architecture

162
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,040
Really nice bridge

163
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,070
Probably Romania

164
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:10,750
Yeah, it should be Romania

165
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,210
Okay, can we find this? Like I have

166
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:14,270
vibes like here

167
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:20,770
maybe Are there any bridges over there?

168
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:26,240
Hmm Doesn't look like there is

169
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:31,340
a bridge here

170
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,540
Oh, maybe this one?

171
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,050
Let's check the angle

172
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:41,050
No, it's definitely not this one

173
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:44,170
It can be border with Bulgaria

174
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:59,070
I think I'm not,

175
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:09,770
I don't think I can find this one

176
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:13,550
It's gonna be fine to find

177
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:14,110
I guess

178
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:14,670
Oh it w

179
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:16,630
as there He got it

180
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:17,510
Oh no,

181
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:20,450
that's not good

182
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:28,000
I can't lose

183
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,680
this Okay

184
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:32,070
We have Ireland

185
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,920
or UK Okay

186
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:39,200
so this is UK

187
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:44,640
We have big hills in the back

188
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,100
So can it be Scotland?

189
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,540
So I think it's Scotland

190
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:54,470
actually The architecture kind of fits

191
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:58,570
Yeah, I'm gonna go Scotland right now

192
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:03,930
Maybe like.. huh Something like there?

193
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:04,820
No, I don't think so

194
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:09,030
I think it's more outskirts area
