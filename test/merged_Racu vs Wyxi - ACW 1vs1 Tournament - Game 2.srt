1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:05,630
Let's start the second game I'm losing 0

2
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:07,630
-1 I need to

3
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:13,810
pop off Okay,

4
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:15,650
so this is just South Africa, right? But

5
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:26,110
where? Might be something like.. Closer to

6
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:32,570
Eswatini Lesotho We have some mountains over there

7
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:35,470
Yeah, I'm gonna send something like here

8
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:40,750
Oh no, definitely not East London Next round

9
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:44,180
we have tracker

10
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:48,670
No, this

11
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:53,540
is just a car

12
00:00:53,540 --> 00:01:00,410
And in water

13
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:03,120
okay so the hills look Colombian

14
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,010
I think but it also might be Mexico

15
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:10,070
where is the Sun Sun is to the Sun

16
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:15,080
is saying nothing it's not good

17
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,420
okay so it's gonna be a 50

18
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:21,400
-50 I guess between Colombia and Mexico

19
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,300
but my first thought was Colombia so I'm gonna go here I thin

20
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:28,520
k It can be Yucatan,

21
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,840
it can be Campeje in Mexico,

22
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,040
but I'm going Colombia Let's see

23
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:44,060
Yeah, it was Nordele Colo

24
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:46,770
Not good

25
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:55,920
I should have committed more towards

26
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,930
north I think it was a

27
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:10,240
mistake but it's fine now

28
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:16,190
we have Ghana probably nothing

29
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:20,120
some red dirt and we have some hills

30
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,700
I think Kumasi should be a good Good guess over here

31
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,040
I think Okay,

32
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:30,360
we are fine

33
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:50,390
Next round

34
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:52,430
We

35
00:02:52,430 --> 00:03:00,380
have English language We have some weird.. weird architecture

36
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,980
What is this car?

37
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:08,780
Is this a tracker? This is no way

38
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,880
This is some kind of island

39
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,900
But I have no idea.. Okay,

40
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:19,950
with this sign.. Like

41
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:24,670
can it be like one of islands close to Australia

42
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:28,090
I think But which ones? Wait

43
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:32,240
No for sure

44
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,760
not this one

45
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,110
Like what else? Like we have

46
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:40,230
some kind of mixed American plus

47
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:44,830
Australian style here

48
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:48,670
What can it be?

49
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:50,660
Oh, wait, maybe it's might be

50
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:54,210
the Christmas Island, I think, or Cocos,

51
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:57,170
one of those two Oh, y

52
00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:02,140
eah, that makes sense But which one? Wait

53
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:04,670
So Christmas Island have this car

54
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:12,830
with like a black ending

55
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:16,260
But Cocos also have a specific car

56
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:19,900
And we have nothing over here

57
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:23,400
This is super weird I've never seen anything like this

58
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,210
Okay, I'm gonna go between, I think

59
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:29,600
Like between those two

60
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,830
Because picking one is actually maybe not a good idea

61
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:35,330
I'm gonna play defensive here Yes, I'm gonna go betw

62
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:39,840
een those two Yeah, okay, it was Christmas Island Sheesh

63
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,550
He knew it

64
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:46,340
That's unlucky

65
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:48,530
Next we

66
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:53,540
have India

67
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:58,690
Okay with these polls

68
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:01,600
Okay so I think this should be Southern I

69
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:08,190
ndia I unfortunately do not know the poll here

70
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,740
But yeah, it's definitely southern

71
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:16,320
part of the India, like maybe Karnataka, closer to Bengaluru

72
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,120
Can I see a bridge here? We have mountains over there,

73
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:25,020
so maybe it makes sense

74
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,180
So I'm going to send something like this

75
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:33,500
maybe Like here

76
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:37,700
Yeah, let's just send

77
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:47,530
Oh, really nice

78
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:53,600
That's a huge damage And I won Nah, 1k

79
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,360
more 1k more, okay

80
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:00,670
So I can win I think I can win thi

81
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:03,450
s I just need a good rounds like this one

82
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:07,780
We have Greece, Greek language

83
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:12,990
We have a bay to the west

84
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:15,090
It should be just mainland I

85
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:19,910
think I'm gonna send something like here

86
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:38,910
Okay, it was just a creepy island

87
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:44,080
It's still okay though I just need small countries

88
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,400
and I can win

89
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:54,080
Okay, we have Poland

90
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,290
Probably just central Poland,

91
00:06:56,290 --> 00:07:00,040
I think M aybe more closer to the north,

92
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,240
I'm gonna come here

93
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,340
I think Oh

94
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:07,720
no, there's no way It was just southern

95
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:12,930
Poland Next round,

96
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:16,000
we

97
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:24,250
have Baltics, like Estonia or Latvia

98
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:27,400
I think Maybe Lithuania

99
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,460
also, we don't have Poles

100
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:34,170
That's not good

101
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:36,990
Okay, so I'm not sure about the country here

102
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:40,870
So I'm just gonna go in middle to the Latvia

103
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:43,210
and hope it's like close

104
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:46,840
Because we don't have any.. Okay,

105
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,170
maybe we have.. No, it's just trees

106
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:51,810
Yeah, so I think it should be fi ne

107
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:54,670
It was just Estonia

108
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:56,770
Not good Next round

109
00:07:56,770 --> 00:08:03,800
Okay so this should be

110
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,990
with this car

111
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:10,590
New Zealand Should be Northern Ireland

112
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:14,130
I think Yes

113
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:23,560
let me just send like something like this

114
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:27,140
hope it's not gonna be the southern island

115
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:32,330
because i am dead if it is so y

116
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:37,340
eah okay it's fine you can get some damage here

117
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:45,700
next round we have a

118
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:50,230
mexican Wait,

119
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,040
it's not Mexico It's Romanian,

120
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:57,820
I think Taxi Maybe it's not a taxi

121
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,940
I thought in the first instance it's Mexico,

122
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:05,550
but we definitely are not in Mexico We have European architecture

123
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:08,070
Really nice bridge Probably Romania

124
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:10,750
Yeah, it should be Romania

125
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,210
Okay, can we find this? Like I have

126
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:20,770
vibes like here maybe Are there any bridges over there?

127
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:26,240
Hmm Doesn't look like there is

128
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:31,340
a bridge here

129
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,540
Oh, maybe this one?

130
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,050
Let's check the angle

131
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:41,050
No, it's definitely not this one

132
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:44,170
It can be border with Bulgaria

133
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:59,070
I think I'm not,

134
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:09,770
I don't think I can find this one

135
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:13,550
It's gonna be fine to find

136
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:14,670
I guess Oh it w

137
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:17,510
as there He got it Oh no,

138
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:20,450
that's not good

139
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:28,000
I can't lose

140
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,070
this Okay We have Ireland

141
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:39,200
or UK Okay so this is UK

142
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:44,640
We have big hills in the back

143
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,100
So can it be Scotland?

144
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:54,470
So I think it's Scotland actually The architecture kind of fits

145
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:58,570
Yeah, I'm gonna go Scotland right now

146
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:03,930
Maybe like.. huh Something like there?

147
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:09,030
No, I don't think so I think it's more outskirts area

148
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:15,440
I'm gonna go here

149
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,430
Yeah, nice! And we won!

150
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:23,970
That's a GG 1

151
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:26,930
1 -1, bounce

152
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:34,320
back
